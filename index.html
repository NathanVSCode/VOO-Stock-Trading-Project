<p class="sup">I have parents that are from Ethiopia. There were 2 reasons they left. The 1st was because there was more opportunity in the US.
     The other reason was because they didn't like the leader Abiy Ahmed. I also have one brother named Noah. My mom's favorite athlete is
    Kobe Bryant. My dad's favorite athlete is Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian runner. My brother's favorite athlete is Lionel Messi. Some memories 
    we all have was when we went to 2 soccer games. They were preseason and the games were Brentfond vs Aston Villa and Chelsea vs Fulham. We had so much fun. The score for the first game was
3-3 and for the 2nd game was 2-0 Chelsea. Another memory I have is when we went to Virginia Beach. It was a vacation. I loved It. We went inside a sweet hotel,they served us breakfast in a different part of the hotel
There was a cool beach that had very nice waves. While the wave was coming at us we would jump over it. My mom did not like it so she just watched me,Noah and my dad do it. It was awesome!</p>
